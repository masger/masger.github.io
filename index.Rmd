I am a medical doctor at CLL-Lab at Rigshospitalet. My research fields are chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pneumococcal disease, where I study how different pathogens are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In general, I am interested in questions like:

- How do antimicrobial usage change in the years before chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis? 
- Whcih risk factors are important for the increased risk of infections?
- What is the best pneumococcal vaccine strategy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia?
- How does the CLL clone develop?
- Etc.  

To answer these questions, I rely on a mix of tools that including classical survival routines, generalized additive models and I am a huge fan of the [**data.table**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/). In addition, I use the [**heaven**](https://github.com/tagteam/heaven) package for fast routines for the Danish health registers. 

On a personal note, I have girlfriend, Sanja Cejvanovic. We welcomed our first child to the family in 2019. Alongside my research, I like to spend time with my family, play disc golf([**PDGA 113200**](https://www.pdga.com/player/113200)) and watch movies.
