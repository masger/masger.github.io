I am a medical doctor at [**CLL-LAB**](https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/english/departments/centre-for-cancer-and-organ-diseases/department-of-haematology/research/Pages/leukemia-laboratory.aspx) at Rigshospitalet. My research fields are chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pneumococcal disease, where I study how different pathogens are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In general, I am interested in questions like:

- How does the leukemia clone develop?
- How do antimicrobial usage change in the years prior chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis? 
- Which risk factors are important for infections among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia?
- When should we vaccinate patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia?
- Etc.  

To answer these questions, I rely on a mix of tools that include classical survival routines and generalized additive models. In addition, I am a huge fan of the [**data.table**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) and I use the [**heaven**](https://github.com/tagteam/heaven) package for the the Danish health registers. 

On a personal note, I have a girlfriend, Sanja Cejvanovic. We welcomed our first child to the family in 2019. Alongside my research, I like to spend time with my family, play disc golf([**PDGA 113200**](https://www.pdga.com/player/113200)) and watch movies.
