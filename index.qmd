:::{#hero-heading}

I am a clinical pharmacologist studying how pharmacogenetic test results change prescribing and patient outcomes. I combine Danish national registry data with prospective clinical trials to measure whether genotype-guided dosing reduces adverse drug reactions and treatment failures.

My current work focuses on CYP2C19-guided antiplatelet therapy, SLCO1B1 genotyping for statin intolerance, and therapeutic drug monitoring of targeted cancer therapies.
